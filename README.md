# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.
My name is Rob. I'm 38 and have been learning programming and web scripting on my own for a long time. I know there is a lot to learn and want to learn from professionals.
I live in Central California and plan to travel with my wife aroud the country with her nursing job. I want to be able to work from wherever I am.
